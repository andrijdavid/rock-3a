# ROCK 3A
[![iso_build](https://github.com/radxa-build/rock-3a/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radxa-build/rock-3a/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## What is this?

A collection of auto-generated images for ROCK 3A.


* Official Armbian can be downloaded from [here](https://www.armbian.com/rock-3a/).
* **Unofficial** Armbian images will have name started with `Armbian`. This is currently disabled since Armbian is not providing their `current` kernel on this board. 
* Radxa debos image will have name started with the board name.
* Manjaro users can visit [here](https://github.com/manjaro-arm/rock3-a-images).

## Where can I download the image?

Built images are uploaded to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/radxa-build/rock-3a/releases/latest).
